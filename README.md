# RandomFilePicker
A program that opens a file at random from a specified directory. Useful for media files like photos, movies, and songs. (Under construction.)

This kind of counts as a coding exercise example, but mostly it's just a quick and dirty utility that I wanted to use at home.

Command line usage:
* directory [the directory to explore ("." for current)]
* -r [make the exploration recursive to all subdirectories]

For Windows users: If you specify a filepath, be warned that its name must not contain spaces (inner recursive directories may).

(Currently only supports Windows 7. Future updates will include other versions of Windows as well as OS X.)
